/**
 * Icon Optimization Plan
 * 
 * The current application is using:
 * - lucide-react (33MB) but only a few specific icons
 * - react-icons (83MB) but not importing any icons from it
 * 
 * Steps to optimize:
 * 
 * 1. For lucide-react:
 *    - Replace import { Icon1, Icon2 } from "lucide-react" 
 *    - With import Icon1 from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/icon1"
 *    - This allows tree-shaking to only include used icons
 * 
 * 2. For react-icons:
 *    - Since we're not using it, we can remove it entirely
 * 
 * The list of icons we actually use from lucide-react:
 * - AlertCircle
 * - ArrowLeft, ArrowRight
 * - Check
 * - ChevronDown, ChevronLeft, ChevronRight, ChevronUp
 * - Circle
 * - Dot
 * - GitBranchPlus
 * - GripVertical
 * - Languages
 * - Loader
 * - MoreHorizontal
 * - PanelLeft
 * - Search
 * - Waves
 * - X

// Example of optimized icon imports:
// Before:
// import { ChevronDown, ChevronLeft, Circle, Languages, Loader, Waves, GitBranchPlus } from "lucide-react";

// After:
// import ChevronDown from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/chevron-down";
// import ChevronLeft from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/chevron-left";
// import Circle from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/circle";
// import Languages from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/languages";
// import Loader from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/loader";
// import Waves from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/waves";
// import GitBranchPlus from "lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/git-branch-plus";

// This approach ensures only the icons you actually use are included in your bundle
